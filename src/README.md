## Installing on Mobile
1. For mobile，you'll need a browser that supports scripts.  I've succesfully used [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US).
2. (Return to this page on your new browser)
3. From Kiwi Browser, install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension
4. After installing the extensions，download the script: https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors/raw/gh-pages/ShinyColors.user.js ，tampermonkey should prompt you to load it
5. Refresh the game page and the patch should work automatically
(If you have played before, you may need to clear your browser's cache and cookies to remove existing Japanese files)
6. It's recommended to add a shortcut to your home menu so that the game plays fullscreen like a native application:
<img src="https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors/blob/master/data/image/MobileInstallTutorial1.jpg" alt="Click the ..." width="30%"><img src="https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors/blob/master/data/image/MobileInstallTutorial2.jpg" alt="Click Add to Home Screen" width="30%" align="right">

**Machine translation**

If no one has submitted a translation for a commu，machine translation can be turned on。

After the game URL add #auto=on ，otherwise leave #auto=off 。

You can also directly click these links，[Machine TL ON](https://shinycolors.enza.fun/home#auto=on)  /  [Machine TL OFF](https://shinycolors.enza.fun/home#auto=off)

**Keep game sound after losing focus**

By default the game stops sound playback after losing window focus，this plug-in can keep sound playing。

After the game URL add #bgm=on ，otherwise leave #bgm=off 。

You can also directly click these links，[Keep playing BGM](https://shinycolors.enza.fun/home#bgm=on)  /  [Pause BGM](https://shinycolors.enza.fun/home#bgm=off)
