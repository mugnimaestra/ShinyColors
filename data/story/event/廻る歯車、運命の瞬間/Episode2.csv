4001002030010,恋鐘,"わぁ、きれいで広か部屋やね
このカラオケボックスは当たりばい！","Wow, it sure is a nice and spacious room. We're lucky to find this Karaoke box."
4001002030020,咲耶,"フフ、確かにこれならみんなでゆったりできそうだ
さて、誰から歌う？","Heh, we'll be able to relax here indeed. Well then, who wants to sing first?"
4001002030030,恋鐘,はいはーい！　うちから歌ってもよか？,Here heeere! Is it alright if I sang first?
4001002030040,恋鐘,"まずはうちが盛り上げると！
みんな続くたい！",I have to liven the mood here first! Everyone'll be after me!
4001002030050,恋鐘,"うちの故郷、長崎を歌った演歌から～！
いっくよ～！","First, an Enka from my hometown of Nagasaki! Let's go!"
4001002030060,結華,さすがこがたん、聴かせる歌って感じ,"As expected of Kogatan, that's a song everyone'll know."
4001002030070,霧子,恋鐘ちゃん、上手だった……,"Kogane, that was really good..."
4001002030080,恋鐘,"そう言ってもらえると嬉しか！
この歌、うちの十八番のひとつやけん！",I'm glad you think that way! This song's one of my specialties!
4001002030090,恋鐘,"さあさ、みんなどんどん入れてくたい！
……あー！　結華、それよかねー！","Go ahead, everyone put your songs in! ...Ah! Yuika, that one's nice!"
4001002030100,結華,"えへへー、これならみんなも歌えるでしょ？
ほら、さくやんもマイク持って","Ehehe, with this everyone'll be able to sing right?
Come on, Sakuyan! You grab a mic too!"
4001002030110,咲耶,フフ、私も一緒に歌っていいのかな？,"Heh, is it alright for me to sing too?"
4001002030120,結華,"こういうのはみんなで盛り上がってこそだからね！
３人も、後でマイク回すから覚悟しといてよー？","This should really be enjoyed with everyone here! The three of you, the mic will be passed on to you later so be prepared, alright?"
4001002030130,恋鐘,おおっ、参加型のライブみたいばい！,"Ooh, this is like a participation type Live!"
4001002030140,恋鐘,"みんな、予約が切れとーよ！
摩美々は何を歌うと？","Everyone, the reservation will end!
What will you sing, Mamimi?"
4001002030150,摩美々,……特にはぁ,...Nothing in particular.
4001002030160,結華,"えー？
三峰、まみみんの美声でノックアウトされたいなー",Eeh? Mitsumine wants to be knocked out by Mamimi's angelic voice!
4001002030170,摩美々,普通にしゃべってるんでー、それ聴いてくださぁい,"We're talking normally, so please listen to that."
4001002030180,結華,"違うじゃーんそういうことじゃないじゃーん
……お？　それまみみんがよく聴いてる歌じゃない？","That's different, that's not what I meant!
...Oh? Isn't that a song Mamimi often listens to?"
4001002030190,摩美々,"あっ、ちょっとー
人が使ってるんだから横からリモコンいじんないでよー","Ah, hey. There's someone using this so don't interrupt from the side using the remote."
4001002030200,結華,これ、入れてみない？,How about inputting this?
4001002030210,摩美々,えー……？,Eh...?
4001002030220,恋鐘,"うちも摩美々の歌聴きたか！
入れてほしか！","I wanna listen to Mamimi sing too!
Please put in that song!"
4001002030230,摩美々,うーん……,Hmm...
4001002030240,摩美々,"……まぁ、今日はいっかぁ
特別ってことにしといてあげますよー","...Well, it's fine for today.
I'll just think of this as a special case."
4001002030250,恋鐘,"うーっ……かっこよか～！
やっぱ咲耶、男性ヴォーカルの曲が似合っと～ばい","Uuuh... That's so cool!
As expected, a song with male vocals fits Sakuya!"
4001002030260,咲耶,"どうもありがとう
楽しんでもらえたなら何よりだよ","Thanks a lot.
I'm just glad you enjoyed it."
4001002030270,結華,あれ？　きりりん、まだ歌ってなくない？,"Huh? Kiririn, you didn't sing at all, did you?"
4001002030280,霧子,"そ……その……わたし……
みんな、上手だなって……","Tha... that's... I...
I think everyone's really good..."
4001002030290,咲耶,"それは嬉しいな
でも、霧子の歌も聴いてみたいよ","I'm glad to hear that.
But, we also want to hear Kiriko's singing."
4001002030300,恋鐘,"おーっ！　今度は霧子の番とね
待ってたばい！",Oh! Now it's Kiriko's turn finally!
4001002030310,霧子,"あ、あの……うん……
……よし……！","E-Erm... ok...
...Alright...!"
4001002030320,霧子,"よ……よろしく……お願いします！
……１、２、３～♪","I... I'm... in your care!
...1, 2, 3♪"
4001002030321,一同,おお～！,Ooh!
4001002030330,咲耶,"へぇ、ゴシック系……と言えばいいのかな
意外だけど、霧子はこういう曲が好きなんだね","Wow, is this what you would call... Gothic?
It's surprising, but I see, so Kiriko likes this type of song."
4001002030340,恋鐘,"うちはこがん曲あまり聴いたことなかったばい！
でも、かっこよかね！","I haven't heard a lot of this type of song! But, it's really cool!"
4001002030350,咲耶,"私はちょうどこういうの、時々聴いているんだ
結構好きかな","It just so happens that I listen to songs like this occasionally, I quite like them."
4001002030360,結華,"そうなんだ？
王子様路線だけじゃないとは、さくやんったら多才だねぇ","Is that so? So you're not only going for the Prince route, Sakuyan sure is talented."
4001002030370,咲耶,"フフ、ありがとう結華
こういった曲には、摩美々のイメージもあるのだけれど","Heh, thanks, Yuika.
Songs like these seem to fit Mamimi's image too."
4001002030380,摩美々,……まぁ、嫌いではないですねー,"...Well, I don't hate it."
4001002030390,結華,"割とみんなの共通項だったり？
やー、まだまだお互い知らないこともあるんだねぇ",We're surprisingly on the same page? Wow! There sure is a lot that we don't know about each other!
4001002030400,霧子,えっと……誰か、次の曲……,"Erm... someone, the next song..."
4001002030410,咲耶,"霧子、すごく良かったよ
私も次はこういった趣向の曲を入れようかな","Kiriko, you sang really well. Maybe I should go for something similar for my next song."
4001002030420,恋鐘,うち、これでやってみたか！,I want to try this!
4001002030430,霧子,……？,Huh...?
4001002030440,恋鐘,"ユニットのコンセプトばい！
うちらはゴシックでやっていきたか！",For the concept of our Unit! We should try Gothic!
4001002030450,咲耶,"なるほど……！　それはいい考えかもしれないね
衣装にも色々とこだわりが出せそうだ",I see...! That might turn out to be a great idea. It seems like we might be able to try many different things for the costume too.
4001002030460,霧子,"わ、わたしは……そういうの、好きだけど……
みんなは……いいのかな……","F-For me... I like things like that, but...
Is everyone... alright with this?..."
4001002030470,摩美々,……みんな、いいって言ってるんだと思うケド,...It sounds like everyone is saying they're okay with it.
4001002030480,結華,"そうそう！　共通の趣味を見つけるのって難しいし、
これはきりりん大手柄だよ！","That's right! It's difficult to find something that we all like, this is all thanks to Kiririn!"
4001002030490,恋鐘,"よし、決まりたい！
うちらのユニットのコンセプトは、ゴシックばい！","Alright, that's decided! The concept for our unit will be Gothic!"
4001002030500,摩美々,"はぁい質問ー、
ゴシックって言っても色々あると思うんだケドー","I have a question. Even though we're going for Gothic, there seems to be a variety of styles."
4001002030510,恋鐘,"いろいろ……？　うちはよくわからんけど
なんとなく真っ黒い吸血鬼とかのイメージたい","A variety...? I don't really know. I somehow imagined it to be completely black, like vampires and such."
4001002030520,結華,"それはかなり限定的かなぁ。もうちょっとこう、
お人形さんみたいなヤツとか、上品な感じのとかもあるよ？","That might be a little limited, but there are also those that are like dolls or those that have an elegant feel to them, you see?"
4001002030530,霧子,"うん……ふわふわした袖とか……
レザーの……古めかしい雰囲気のとかも……素敵だよね",Yes... there are also frilled sleeves... or leather... even those with vintage feel to them... It sure is lovely.
4001002030540,咲耶,"なるほど……簡単には決められそうにないな
ゴシック、なかなか奥が深そうだね","I see... it doesn't seem like we'd be able to decide that easily. Gothic, there's more to it than it seems."
4001002030550,結華,絞っていくんだったら、画像とか見つつ詰めた方が──,"If we're to narrow it down, I think it's better to look at some images──"
4001002030560,摩美々,時間はなさそうだねー,It doesn't seem like we have the time.
4001002030570,咲耶,"そうだね、ここは出ようか
もっと話を続けたいところだけど──","You're right, let's leave this place.
I'd like to continue this conversation, but──"
4001002030580,恋鐘,"それじゃあ、ファミレスにでも行って
アイディアを詰めていくばい！","Then let's go to a family restaurant
to compile our ideas!"
