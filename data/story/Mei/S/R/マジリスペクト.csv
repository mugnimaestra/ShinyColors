お疲れさまっした～","Phew,
I'm pretty tired~"
3019002020020,冬優子,お疲れ様でした！,Good job.
3019002020030,愛依,"冬優子ちゃん、お疲れ～
レッスン、ちょーしんどかったよね～","Oh, Fuyuko, good job~
The lesson was pretty difficult, wasn't it~?"
3019002020040,冬優子,"うん、疲れたね～
振り付けもちょっと難しいところがあったもんね！","Yeah, I felt tired too.
The choreography had some quite difficult parts!"
3019002020050,愛依,"そういうけどさ～、冬優子ちゃん、
けっこー出来てた系じゃない？","Actually, Fuyuko,
Wasn't there something that we could've done?"
3019002020060,冬優子,え～、そんなことないよ？,Eh? That's not true~
3019002020070,愛依,いやいや、うちより全然できてたし,"No-no, I wouldn't be able to do it at all either way."
3019002020080,愛依,"練習してっとことか全然見ないのに
できちゃうとかマジリスペクトだわ～","I couldn't focus my surroundings after the practice.
Big respect to people that can do it~"
3019002020090,冬優子,"えへへ、ありがとう！
でもでも、愛依ちゃんもキレがあって良かったよ～！","Ehehe, thanks!
But-but, you were as sharp as well!"
3019002020100,愛依,え～、そっかな～、サンキュ～！,"Eh, is that so? Thanks!"
3019002020110,愛依,"え、てか、冬優子ちゃんはアイドル的にちょー可愛いし
ステージの上でもなんつーかヤバいし！","But, Fuyuko, you're such a cute Idol~
Something like you on stage, would've been totally great!"
3019002020120,愛依,マジ、アイドル向いてるってカンジするわ！,"Seriously, I feel like I can't be an Idol at all!"
3019002020130,冬優子,"あ、あんまり褒められると
照れちゃうよ……","D-Don't praise me that much...
I feel flustered..."
3019002020140,愛依,でもさ～、いいよね～,But you're good~
3019002020150,冬優子,？,Hm?
3019002020160,愛依,"うち、結構不器用系じゃん？
全然できないこと多いっていうか～","Like, I'm pretty clumsy~
And that I can't really do much~"
3019002020170,愛依,"だから冬優子ちゃんの才能あるカンジ
マジうらやま～","That's why! You're pretty talented!
Seriously talented~"
3019002020180,冬優子,そんなこと……,Saying such a thing like that...
3019002020190,冬優子,…………,……
3019002020200,愛依,"？　冬優子ちゃん？
どったの～？","Hm? Fuyuko?
Something wrong?"
3019002020210,冬優子,え？　ううん、なんでもないよ♡,"Huh? Oh, nothing♡"
3019002020220,冬優子,"……あ、そろそろ行かないと
ふゆ、ちょっと急ぎの予定思い出しちゃった！","...Oh, I have to go soon,
Fuyu just remembered about her schedule!"
3019002020230,愛依,"え～？　そうなん～？
一緒に帰ろうと思ったのに～","Eh? Is that so~?
I thought you said we could go home together~"
3019002020240,冬優子,"うん、ごめんね
愛依ちゃん、お疲れ様！","Ah, sorry about that.
Mei, I'll be going!"
3019002020250,愛依,うぃ～、お疲れ～,"Okay, see ya~"
3019002020260,愛依,"冬優子ちゃん、な～んか変だったな～
なんでだろ？","Fuyuko felt pretty strange~
I wonder why?"
3019002020270,愛依,"……ま、いーや
うちもそろそろ帰ろっと──","...Well, it was probably nothing~
I'll just go home~"
3019002020280,愛依,"あ、もしもし～
今～、ヒマヒマ～","Ah, what is it?
Yeah, I'm coming back~"
3019002020290,愛依,"え～、マジで、行く行く～
