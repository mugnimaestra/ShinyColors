今日も早いね","Good morning, Kiriko.
You're early again today."
3006003020020,霧子,"咲耶さん……おはよう……
それ……ビニール傘……？","Sakuya... good morning...
Is that... a vinyl umbrella...?"
3006003020030,咲耶,"ああ、これかい？
たまにはシンプルなものもいいかと思ってね","Oh, you mean this? I thought that it might be nice to use something simple once in a while."
3006003020040,霧子,"でも、前の傘……
お気に入りって……",But your previous umbrella... You said that it was one of your favorites...
3006003020050,咲耶,フフ。たまには気分転換も必要さ,Heh. It's necessary to have a change of mood once in a while.
3006003020060,霧子,そうなんだね……,I see...
3006003020070,恋鐘,おっはよー！　今日もバリバリ頑張らんとね！,Mornin'! Let's do our utmost best today as well!
3006003020080,咲耶,"おはよう恋鐘
フフ、ジメジメした空気を吹き飛ばすような元気さだね","Good morning, Kogane. Heh, that energy of yours seems to blow away even this clammy atmosphere."
3006003020090,霧子,あ、恋鐘ちゃん……雨、大丈夫だった……？,"Ah, Kogane... were you alright with the rain...?"
3006003020100,恋鐘,"んふふー。うちが来る時は全然降っとらんかったよー
うちってバリついとるよね！","Mhehe! It wasn't rainin' when I came here!
I sure am lucky ain't I!?"
3006003020110,恋鐘,でも、ちゃーんと傘も持って……,"But, I made sure to bring my umbrella..."
3006003020111,恋鐘,"……って、あれ？　ない？
なかよ～！？","...Wait, huh? It's gone?
It's not here!?"
3006003020120,霧子,こ、恋鐘ちゃん……？,K-Kogane...?
3006003020130,咲耶,どうしたんだい、恋鐘？,"What seems to be the matter, Kogane?"
3006003020140,恋鐘,なかとよ！　うちの傘がー！,It's not here! My umbrella!
3006003020150,霧子,あの……水色の……？,Um... is it the blue one...?
3006003020160,恋鐘,"そう、それたい！　
あー！　どこに置いて来たっちゃろ！？","Yea, that's it!
Ah! Where did I put it!?"
3006003020170,恋鐘,あの傘、お気に入りやったのに……,And that umbrella was one of my favorites...
3006003020180,咲耶,"……恋鐘、そんなに落ちこむことはないよ
一緒に傘を探しに行こう","...Kogane, don't be sad.
Let's go find your umbrella together."
3006003020190,咲耶,"恋鐘と私のレッスンまで、まだ時間もあるし
ふたりで探した方が効率的だ","There's still time until our lesson, so it's more efficient with the two of us looking."
3006003020200,恋鐘,"ありがと～！
咲耶が来てくれるなら頼もしか～","Thanks!
It's reassuring to have Sakuya with me!"
3006003020210,霧子,"一緒に探したいけど……ごめんね……
レッスンが……始まっちゃう……","I'd love to help look for it but... I'm sorry...
My lesson... is about to start..."
3006003020220,咲耶,"大丈夫だよ。私達もすぐに戻ってくるから
霧子も、レッスン頑張っておいで","Don't worry about it. We'll be back soon.
Kiriko, you go do your best at lessons as well."
3006003020230,恋鐘,"そうたい！
パパーっと見つけてくるけんね！","That's right!
We'll find it in a jiffy!"
3006003020240,霧子,"う、うん……いってらっしゃい……
気をつけてね……！","Y-Yes... take care...
Please be careful...!"
3006003020250,咲耶,"さて、とりあえず恋鐘が事務所まで来た道を
辿ってみるとしようか","Well then, for now,
let's trace back Kogane's route to the office."
3006003020260,恋鐘,"そうやねぇ……
あ、でもうち、今日は結構寄り道しとったかも……","Yer right...
Ah, but I might've taken lots of detours today..."
3006003020270,咲耶,"クス。大丈夫だよ
ゆっくり、ひとつずつ行ってみようじゃないか","Heh, don't worry.
Let's take our time and go back one by one."
3006003020280,恋鐘,うん！　じゃあまずは……,Yea! Then firstly...
3006003020290,咲耶,"このコンビニでもなかったか……
じゃあ次は……","So it's not in this convenience store as well...
Then next is..."
3006003020300,恋鐘,"今度こそ、見つかるけん
──あ……！","We'll definitely find it next.
Ah...!"
3006003020310,咲耶,"おや、雨が降ってきたようだね
傘を持ってきていて良かったよ","Oh my, it seems to have started raining.
I'm glad I brought my umbrella."
3006003020320,恋鐘,さすが咲耶！　準備万端やね！,As expected of Sakuya! Yer well prepared!
3006003020330,咲耶,フフ。さあ、濡れないうちにどうぞ,"Heh. Well, before you get wet, please."
3006003020340,恋鐘,"うん、ありがとう！
うち、傘探すの頑張るけんね！","Yea, thanks!
I'll do my best to find my umbrella!"
3006003020350,恋鐘,今度は、咲耶をうちの傘に入れてあげるばい！,Then next time I'll let Sakuya under my umbrella!
3006003020360,咲耶,"クス。それは楽しみだな
……さあ、次の場所へ行こうか","Heh, I look forward to it
...Well then, let's go to the next location."
3006003020370,恋鐘,"うん！　だいたいのとこは寄ったけん、
きっとすぐ見つかると～！","Yea! We've gone to almost all the places,
we'll definitely be able to find it soon!"
3006003020380,咲耶,──次はあっちの本屋へ行くのかい？,Are we going to that bookstore next?
3006003020390,恋鐘,"うん！　みんなの載ってる雑誌が出とるたい
店に並んでるところが見たかったんよ",Yea! The magazine with everyone's article is out! I wanted to see the magazines on the shelves.
3006003020400,咲耶,フフ。恋鐘らしいね,"Heh, that sounds like something you would do."
3006003020410,咲耶,"……おや？　肩が少し濡れてしまっているよ
もっと内側に入っておいで","...Oh? Your shoulder is getting a little wet.
Come a little closer to me."
3006003020420,恋鐘,"ううん、うちは大丈夫ばい！
そげんことより、咲耶が濡れたらいけんよ！","Oh don't worry 'bout me!
More importantly, it'll be bad if Sakuya got wet!"
3006003020430,咲耶,"フフ。その気持ちだけで十分だよ
それに、恋鐘が風邪をひいたら悲しいな","Heh. Just that thought alone means a lot to me.
Plus, I'll be sad if Kogane caught a cold."
3006003020440,咲耶,"ほら、どうぞ
私の腕で良ければ、掴まっていてくれないかな？","Here, please If you don't mind,
would you like to hold onto my arm?"
3006003020450,恋鐘,"よ、よかと？
じゃ、じゃあ、そうするばい……","I-Is that fine?
T-Then I'll do just that..."
3006003020460,恋鐘,"えへへ。咲耶が本物の王子様みたいで
うち、なんだか照れるっちゃけど……っ！",Eheheh. Sakuya is like a real prince! Somehow I'm feeling a little embarrassed...!
3006003020470,咲耶,私も、恋鐘をエスコートできて光栄だよ,I too feel like it's an honor to be the one to escort Kogane.
3006003020480,咲耶,さあ、あともう少し、頑張ろうじゃないか,"Well then, let's do our best for a little bit more."
3006003020490,恋鐘,うん！,Yea!
3006003020500,恋鐘,"あ、あったー！
うちの傘、あったばい、咲耶！","H-Here it is!
We found my umbrella, Sakuya!"
3006003020510,咲耶,"見つかって良かったよ
恋鐘が頑張って探したからだね","I'm glad we were able to find it.
It's all thanks to Kogane doing her best."
3006003020520,恋鐘,"いや、咲耶のおかげたい！
咲耶はうちの傘の恩人やね！","No, it's all thanks to Sakuya!
Sakuya is my umbrella's savior!"
3006003020530,咲耶,"フフ
恋鐘の大事な傘が見つかって、私も嬉しいよ",Heh. I'm just glad we were able to find Kogane's precious umbrella.
3006003020540,咲耶,"（こんなふうに人と喜びを分かち合えるなら……
雨の日も、案外悪くないね）",(Being able to share someone's happiness like this... rainy days aren't all that bad.)
