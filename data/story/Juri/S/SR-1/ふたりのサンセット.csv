3011003010010,樹里,"（プロデュ－サ－との打ち合わせも
早めに終わったけど、どうするかな……）","(My meeting with the producer ended sooner than I thought,
I wonder what I can do now...)"
3011003010020,樹里,"……ん？
あそこにいるのは……","...Hm?
Someone over there..."
3011003010030,樹里,よお、夏葉。何してんだ？,"Oh, Natsuha. What are you doing?"
3011003010040,夏葉,あら、樹里じゃない,"Oh, well if it isn't Juri."
3011003010050,夏葉,見ての通り、ジョギングよ,"As you can see, I'm jogging."
3011003010060,夏葉,"普段から時間があったら走るようにしているの
事務所の周りの開拓を兼ねてね","Usually around times like these,
I go for a jog around the office."
3011003010070,樹里,へぇ、よくやるな,"Huh, so you do this often."
3011003010080,夏葉,これぐらい、大したことないわ,"Well, it isn't really anything special."
3011003010090,夏葉,アナタの方は何をしていたの？,"Besides, what are you doing here?"
3011003010100,樹里,今、打ち合わせが終わったところだ,"Well, I just finished a meeting someone here."
3011003010110,樹里,"この後の予定は……まぁ、特にないな
街をぶらつくぐらいだ","My plans right now...
is basically doing nothing for now."
3011003010120,夏葉,そう。つまり休息を取るのね,"I see, in other words, you're currently free right now."
3011003010130,樹里,……なんか問題でもあるのかよ,Is there a problem about that!?
3011003010140,夏葉,"別に、そんなことはないわ
疲れているなら、休むべきよ","Not really, it's nothing like that.
If you're tired, you should give yourself a rest."
3011003010150,夏葉,"何より大事なのは、
日々の鍛錬と休息のバランスだもの","What's more important,
Is to create a nice and healthy balance everyday."
3011003010160,樹里,別に、疲れてるわけじゃね－よ,It's not like I'm tired or anything.
3011003010170,夏葉,"でも、運動ができるほどではないから
休むんでしょう？","But if you aren't in the mood to work out,
Isn't it the time to give yourself a rest?"
3011003010180,樹里,う、運動ぐらい、できるっての！,I-I can go for an exercise right now!
3011003010190,樹里,"アタシだってな、アンタが知らないだけで
普段から運動してて、体力はあるんだからな！","You really don't know that I usually work out everyday,
and check my body's condition."
3011003010200,夏葉,そう、良いことじゃない,Oh really? That's good to hear!
3011003010210,樹里,くっ……！,Tch...
3011003010220,樹里,"（このまんま帰ったら……
なんか、負けた気がする……！）","(In this case,
I feel like I can't afford to lose.)"
3011003010230,樹里,（こうなったら……！）,(In this case...!)
3011003010240,夏葉,"……急に黙り込んでどうしたの？
やっぱり疲れているんじゃない？","...Why are you suddenly out of breath?
You really are tired, aren't you?"
3011003010250,樹里,だから、疲れてね－って言ってるだろ！,Didn't I already say that I'm not tired at all!?
3011003010260,樹里,"折角だ！　アンタのその鍛錬とやらに、
付き合ってやるよ！","I know!
I can take you head-to-head right now!"
3011003010270,夏葉,……そう,...I see.
3011003010280,夏葉,"アナタがそう言うなら止めないわ
でも、途中でバテても知らないわよ？","If you say so, I guess I can't stop you.
But are you sure that you'll be able to keep up with me?"
3011003010290,樹里,"勝手に心配してろ
ほら、行くぞ！","For sure, don't mind it at all!
Let's go!"
3011003010300,樹里,"（……そういや、アタシも事務所の周りは
あんまり走ったことなかったな）","(Come to think of it, I never really jogged
in this area of the office before...)"
3011003010310,夏葉,"ぼんやりして、どうかしたの？
もしかして、疲れてきたのかしら？","Why are you suddenly dozing off? What happened?
Don't tell me you're already tired?"
3011003010320,樹里,"んなわけね－だろ
遅すぎてアクビが出そうなくらいだ！","I mean, you're right.
It's too late for me to yawn!"
3011003010330,夏葉,そう、まだ元気ならいいわ,"I see, you're still quite energetic!"
3011003010340,夏葉,"それじゃあウォ－ミングアップはやめて
ペ－スをあげるわよ！","So now, we're done with the warm-ups,
It's time to raise our pace."
3011003010350,樹里,"……はっ。ペ－ス上げてこの程度とか、
そっちこそもうバテたんじゃねえか？","..Hah, we're raising the pace?
Are you sure you'll be able to keep up with me, then?"
3011003010360,夏葉,"ふぅっ……私はまだまだいけるわ
それより、自分の心配をしたらどうっ？","I can still keep on going,
Anyways, you should be more worried about yourself."
3011003010370,樹里,"はっ……そりゃこっちのセリフだ！
まだまだペ－ス、あげるからなっ！","Heh, took the words right out of my mouth.
I can still go on for a even-faster-pace!"
3011003010380,夏葉,はぁっ、はぁっ……,Ha... Haa...
3011003010390,樹里,はぁっ……はぁっ……はぁっ……！,Ha... Haaa... Haa...!
3011003010400,樹里,"はぁ……はぁ……はぁ……
ここで行き止まり、みたい……だな","Ha... Ha... Hah...
This seems like a good spot to stop at, right?"
3011003010410,夏葉,はぁ……そう、ね……はぁ……はぁ……,Ha... Yeah... Haa... Hah...
3011003010420,夏葉,"ふふっ……見て
夕焼けが、すごく綺麗よ……","Heh, look...
The sunset, is really beautiful..."
3011003010430,樹里,"んっ……ほんとだ……
こんなに景色が良いところ、あったんだな……","It sure is. Great that we were able to catch
such a wonderful sight."
3011003010440,夏葉,"そうね
とても、素敵だわ……","You're right.
This is quite wonderful."
3011003010450,夏葉,"あら。あっちに見えるのって、
私たちがいたところじゃない？","Ah, look over there.
Weren't we just there before?"
3011003010460,樹里,"ああ、そうだな。アタシたち
ずいぶん遠くまで走ってきたんだな……","...Ah yeah, I guess we ran out
pretty far without knowing..."
3011003010470,樹里,……って、ここどこだよ,"...Hold on, where are we even at!?"
3011003010480,夏葉,"……わからないわ
アナタ、行き先も考えずに走っていたの？","I honestly have no idea.
Should've been thinking about where we were going..."
3011003010490,樹里,"し、仕方ねぇだろ
そういうテメ－も同じだろうが","These things happen, which can't be helped, really. You should've done the same thing."
3011003010500,夏葉,……ふふ、まぁね,"...Haha, I guess so."
3011003010510,樹里,まぁ……お互い様ってやつか,I guess.. we are similar in ways.
3011003010520,夏葉,"ふふ
今日はありがとう、いつもより楽しかったわ","Haha.
Thank you for today, it was more a lot more fun than usual."
3011003010530,樹里,"アタシもだ
こんなに走ったのは久しぶりだったけど……","Felt the same about that!
It's been quite a while since I ran this much."
3011003010540,樹里,"思いっきり走るって、
気持ち良いもんだな","I ran with all my strength,
and it felt refreshing for me."
