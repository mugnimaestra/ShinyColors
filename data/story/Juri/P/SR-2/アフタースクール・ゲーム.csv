……ん？　あそこにいるのは……）","(It's ten minutes before the scheduled time.
...Hmm? Isn't that──)"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,樹里っ！,Juri!
2011005110010,樹里,お、プロデューサー,"Oh, Producer."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……悪い、待たせたか？,"Sorry about that, did I make you wait?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"俺も早めに来たつもりだったけど
それより前に来てたとは……",I wanted to get here as soon as possible but it seems that you arrived earlier.
2011005110020,樹里,"別にそんな待ってねーよ？
だからそこまで焦んなくても……","I didn't wait for that long.
So, you don't have to get all worked up like that."
2011005110030,樹里,"いくら休みっつったってよ
アンタはさ……色々忙しーだろ？","Besides, we can't waste time just because it's a day-off.
After all, aren't you got your hands full with a lot of things?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"いやいや……そんなことないぞ
俺はただ楽しみで早く来ただけだしな","No, that's not it at all.
I was just really looking forward to this that I came early."
2011005110040,樹里,なっ……！,Wha...!
2011005110050,樹里,"……あ、アタシはそんなんじゃねーからなっ！
学校がたまたま早く終わっただけだ！","...T-That's not the case for me!
School just happened to end early today!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"はは……わかってるよ
樹里は真面目だからな","Haha, I know.
You really are serious about things."
2011005110060,樹里,……なんだよそれ,What's with that?
2011005110070,樹里,"でも……わかってんならいーんだよ
わかってんなら","But... If you know what I meant, then it's all good.
*If* you know."
2011005110080,樹里,"じゃあ、行こうぜ
もう開場してるみたいだしよ","Well, let's go.
It looks like it's now open."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,おお、そうだな,"Oh, you're right."
2011005110090,樹里,楽しかったーっ！,That was so fun!
2011005110100,樹里,"あのサヨナラのヒットは燃えたなー！！
生で見れてよかったー！","That game-ending hit sure was exciting!
I'm so glad to have seen it live!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"はは、本当に楽しかったんだな
息抜きもできたみたいでよかったよ","Haha, it sure was.
It's nice to see that you've managed to unwind."
2011005110110,樹里,アタシはそうだけどさ……,This is just me...
2011005110120,樹里,"プロデューサーは……
……息抜きになったのかよ","Producer...
...It seems that you got to unwind yourself."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,え？,Eh?
2011005110130,樹里,"アンタは……こう、
大声を出して楽しむってこともあんまりねーだろ？","You... You don't have many chances to let your voice out loud and have fun, right?"
2011005110140,樹里,"アタシたちのライブの時だって……
舞台袖で静かに見守ってるだけだしさ","When during our lives... You were just there in the backstage, silently watching over us."
2011005110150,樹里,"たまには声出して楽しめたら
スッキリするかなって思ったんだ","So, I thought that it'd freshen you up if you let out voice and enjoy yourself once in a while."
2011005110160,樹里,"まぁ……だから
野球観戦くらいしか思いつかなかったんだけどよ",Well... That's the reason why I could only think off watching a baseball match with you.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……そんなこと考えてくれてたのか
ありがたいな","So, that was what you're thinking.
Thank you."
2011005110170,樹里,"本当なら、プロデューサーに頼らずに
用意したかったんだけど……上手くいかなくて","Actually, I wanted to set things up without asking for your help but... I just couldn't do it right."
2011005110180,樹里,"チケットを買う時は、手伝ってもらっちまったし
……悪かったな","You even helped out when buying the tickets.
...Sorry about that."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"樹里……
もしかして、最初から俺のために……","Juri...
You mean, ever since, this was all for me?"
2011005110190,樹里,まぁ、そーなる……かな,"Well, you could say that."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"気付かなかった……
てっきり友達と行くんだと……","I didn't even notice...
I was sure that you'll be going with a friend..."
2011005110200,樹里,なっ、なかなか言い出せなかったんだよ！,I-I just didn't get to say it!
2011005110210,樹里,"……アタシだって、それなりに
プロデューサーには……感謝してんだよ","...Even I'm grateful for
all the things you've done."
2011005110220,樹里,"アイドルに誘ってくれたあの日からずっと……
アタシを支えてくれてるから",Ever since that day when you asked me to become an idol... you were always supporting me.
2011005110230,樹里,"……たまにはいいだろ？
こーやって気持ちを形にするのもさ……","It's not bad to do this once in a while, right?
Being able to express my feelings like this..."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,…………,……
2011005110240,樹里,……あーもう、なんか言えよ！,"Ah! Come on, say something!"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,す、すまん。驚きと感動でつい……,S-Sorry. I was just both surprised and moved at the same time...
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"でも、本当にありがとう
ここまで樹里を見守れて、俺は誇りに思うよ","Still, thank you.
I'm really proud that I was able to look after you all this time."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"これから先も、何があったって
しっかり樹里をサポートしていくからな！","Even from now on, no matter what happens, I will always be supportive of you, Juri!"
2011005110250,樹里,"……ふん
かっこいいじゃねーか","Heh, that's so
cool of you."
2011005110260,樹里,"アタシも、もっと頑張るからさ
これからもよろしくな。プロデューサー！","I, too, will keep on doing my best.
So, I'll be counting on you, Producer!"
